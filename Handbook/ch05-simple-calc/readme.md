# Calc

Based on the task from:  
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-FPGA-Programming-Handbook-Second-Edition/tree/main/CH5

My version of the interface is:

```
        Mult
Minus   Mode    Plus
        Div
```

The **Mode** switch toggles the 7‑segment display between showing the **current total** of the calculation and the **current switch values**.
